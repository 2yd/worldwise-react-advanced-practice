# Worldwise - Interactive Map Application

## Project Overview

Worldwise is a full-featured geography application structured as a modern single-page app. By combining the power of React, higher-order Hooks, React Router and Leaflet, it offers a high-performance interactive map with an engaging user experience. Significant focus is given to performant and efficient operation, with advanced techniques like code splitting used to maximize loading speeds and user responsiveness.

## Features

-  **Dynamic, interactive mapping:** Leveraging Leaflet to deliver live, responsive cartographic display
-  **State management with higher-order Hooks:** useContext and useReducer are used for effective global state management
-  **Routing with React Router:** Allows seamless navigation between views without page reloads
-  **Performance optimized:** Implementing useMemo and useCallback Hooks to maximize component performance and responsiveness.
-  **Lazy loading:** Capitalizing on React's built-in support for code splitting via the lazy function and Suspense

## Technologies Used

-  **React.js**
-  **React Router**
-  **Higher-order React Hooks (useReducer,useContext)**
-  **Leaflet**
-  **Code Optimization (useMemo, useCallback)**
-  **Code Splitting (React.lazy)**
